                            <p>About 3,000 tourists were left stranded as Sikkim was struck by flash flooding owing to
                                incessant rains. The Pegong area in North Sikkim was reportedly affected the most. The
                                flash flooding led to the closure of National Highway 10. According to reports, people
                                are stranded on both sides of the highway.</p>

                            <p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk said the current AI systems can pass all human tests better than
                                humans. He reiterated that advanced AI poses a risk to the public. "The most likely
                                outcome [for AI] is positive, but we need to minimise the possibility that something
                                could go wrong with digital superintelligence," Musk stated.</p>
